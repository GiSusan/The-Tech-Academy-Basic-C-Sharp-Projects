## Math and Comparison Operators (Assignment) | Anonymous Income Comparison Program

The "Anonymous Income Comparison Program" is a console application written in C# that allows you to compare the annual salaries of two individuals based on their hourly rates and hours worked per week.

### Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the hourly rate and hours worked per week for Person 1 and Person 2.
3. The program will calculate the annual salaries for both individuals using the provided input.
4. The annual salaries of Person 1 and Person 2 will be displayed on the console.
5. The program will determine if Person 1 makes more money than Person 2 and display the result.

### Input Validation

The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numeric values for the hourly rates and hours worked per week. If invalid input is detected, appropriate error messages will be displayed, and the program will exit.

### Decimal Precision

To provide more accurate calculations, the program uses the `decimal` data type for storing hourly rates, ensuring decimal precision in the salary calculations.

### Important Note

Please note that this code assumes that the user will enter valid numeric input for the hourly rates and hours worked per week. If the input does not adhere to this expectation, the program will display error messages and exit. Additional validation or error handling can be added as per specific requirements.



## Console Application - Number Operations

This console application performs various mathematical operations on user inputs and displays the results.

### Operations

1. Multiply by 50: Takes an input from the user, multiplies it by 50, and prints the result to the console.

2. Add 25: Takes an input from the user, adds 25 to it, and prints the result to the console.

3. Divide by 12.5: Takes an input from the user, divides it by 12.5, and prints the result to the console.

4. Greater than 50: Takes an input from the user, checks if it is greater than 50, and prints the true/false result to the console.

5. Calculate Remainder: Takes an input from the user, divides it by 7, and prints the remainder to the console.

### Usage
