## Math and Comparison Operators (Assignment) | Anonymous Income Comparison Program

The "Anonymous Income Comparison Program" is a console application written in C# that allows you to compare the annual salaries of two individuals based on their hourly rates and hours worked per week.

### Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the hourly rate and hours worked per week for Person 1 and Person 2.
3. The program will calculate the annual salaries for both individuals using the provided input.
4. The annual salaries of Person 1 and Person 2 will be displayed on the console.
5. The program will determine if Person 1 makes more money than Person 2 and display the result.

### Input Validation

The program includes input validation to ensure that the user enters valid numeric values for the hourly rates and hours worked per week. If invalid input is detected, appropriate error messages will be displayed, and the program will exit.

### Decimal Precision

To provide more accurate calculations, the program uses the `decimal` data type for storing hourly rates, ensuring decimal precision in the salary calculations.
