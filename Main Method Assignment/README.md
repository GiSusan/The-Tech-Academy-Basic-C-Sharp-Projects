# Math Operations Console Application

This console application demonstrates the use of a class to perform various math operations based on different input types (integer, decimal, and string). The application showcases method overloading, where methods with the same name but different parameter types are used to perform specific math operations.

## Getting Started

To run the Math Operations Console Application, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have a C# development environment set up on your machine.
2. Clone or download the source code for the application from the repository.
3. Open the solution file (`MathOperationsApp.sln`) in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

1. Build the solution to compile the code.
2. Locate and open the `Program.cs` file within the project.
3. In the `Main()` method, execute the application by running the program.

   The program will call three different methods in the `MathOperations` class, each performing a math operation based on different input types (integer, decimal, and string).

4. The program will display the results of each method on the console.

   Example output:  Integer Result: 10
                    Decimal Result: 5
                    String Result: 49


5. After displaying the results, the program will wait for you to press Enter before exiting.
