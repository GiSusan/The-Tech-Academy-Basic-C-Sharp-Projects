# Math Operations Console Application

This console application demonstrates the use of a separate class file to perform various math operations on a user-provided number. The application allows the user to input a number, and then performs doubling, squaring, and factorial calculations on that number.

## Getting Started

To run the Math Operations Console Application, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have a C# development environment set up on your machine.
2. Clone or download the source code for the application from the repository.
3. Open the solution file (`MathOperationsApp.sln`) in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

1. Build the solution to compile the code.
2. Locate and open the `Program.cs` file within the project.
3. In the `Main()` method, execute the application by running the program.

   The application will prompt you to enter a number. Provide an integer input and press Enter.
   
   Example:    Enter a number: 5


4. The program will then perform the following math operations on the input number:
- Double the number
- Square the number
- Calculate the factorial of the number

The result of each operation will be displayed on the console.

    Example:    Double: 10
                Square: 25
                Factorial: 120
