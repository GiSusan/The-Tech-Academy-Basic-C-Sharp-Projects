# Method Class Assignment - Math Operations Console App 

This console application demonstrates the usage of a `MathOperations` class to perform mathematical operations and display results.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the solution in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved and the application is compiled successfully.
4. Run the application.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two files:

1. `MathOperations.cs`: This file contains the `MathOperations` class, which encapsulates the math operations and result display logic.
2. `Program.cs`: This file contains the `Program` class with the `Main` method, responsible for executing the application.

## Usage

When the application is executed, it performs the following steps:

1. Instantiates the `MathOperations` class.
2. Calls the `PerformMathOperation` method of the `MathOperations` class, passing two integer numbers.
3. The `PerformMathOperation` method performs a math operation on the first number and displays the second number to the console.
4. It then calls the `DisplayResult` method within the `MathOperations` class, passing the result and the second number.
5. The `DisplayResult` method displays the result and the second number to the console.
6. It then recursively calls the `PerformMathOperation` method with the second number and a new value.
