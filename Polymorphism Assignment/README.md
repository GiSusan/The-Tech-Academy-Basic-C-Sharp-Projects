# Polymorphism Assignment Submission

This is a console application that demonstrates the usage of interfaces and polymorphism in C#.

## Description

The application includes the following features:

1. An interface called `IQuittable` is defined with a method called `Quit()`.
2. The `Employee` class inherits from the `IQuittable` interface and implements the `Quit()` method.
3. Polymorphism is used to create an object of type `IQuittable` and call the `Quit()` method on it.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to ensure there are no errors.
4. Press the F5 key or click the Start button to run the console application.

You should see the output message "Employee quits the job." displayed in the console window.
